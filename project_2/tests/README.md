## Explenation of tests

**doubble_number_network.py** - Simple unit test that verifies that our neural network is implemented correctly by building models that is capable of multiplying and exponentiating numbers.

**Jupyter notebooks** - Mirrors some of the notebooks suffixed _production in the /notebooks directiory with all .savefig calls commented out or removed to enable easy testing without overwriting any figures used in the report. They have been pre-run with sensible defaults and should be self-describing. In particular; the printed learning rate history shows roughly the steps required to reproduce similar results.
