\begin{abstract}
   In this paper we aim to explore the application of three distinct regression methods to both a sampling of the Franke function, as well as a set of terrain data. We utilize the ordinary-least-square (OLS) regression, Ridge regression and LASSO regression along with bootstrap and k-fold cross-validation resampling techniques in order to create and asses predictive polynomial models. We analyze the performance of the different regression models on the two data sets, with the ultimate goal of determining the best regression method and the best predictive polynomial model for each data set.

\section{Introduction}
    \noindent
    In essence, Linear Regression is the process of taking points from a function, or a set of measurements and mapping them to coordinates in a choosen basis in order to create an approximation, or model of your original dataset.
\section{Theory}
    See \textcite{hastie}
    \subsection{Linear Regression}
        Consider a set of data points $\{(x_1, y_n), \dots, (x_N, y_N)\}$ which we wish to fit to some linear model $\mathbf y()$
        \begin{itemize}
            \item describe the general problem
            \item brief description of design matrix
            \item brief introduction to the cost function
            \item discuss different choices of bases. explain why $\mathbb P_n$ is often a good choice. Perhaps also touch on overfitting.
        \end{itemize}


        \subsubsection{Ordinary Least Squares}
            \noindent
            In ordinary least squares (OLS), we aim to find an optimal set of parameters $\pmb{\hat\beta} = [\hat\beta_0, \dots, \hat\beta_n]^T$ such that the $L^2$ norm $\norm{\mathbf y - \textup{X}\pmb{\beta}}_2$ is minimal, with the $L^2$ norm being induced by the inner product
            \begin{equation}
                \norm{\mathbf u}_2^2 = \sum_i u_i^2 = \mathbf u^T \mathbf u
            \end{equation}
            This defines the cost function for OLS, which may be written as
            \begin{equation}
                C_{OLS}(\pmb \beta)
                = \qty(\mathbf y - \textup{X}\pmb \beta)^T(\mathbf y - \textup{X}\pmb \beta)
            \end{equation}
            In order to find its minima, we differentiate wrt to $\pmb\beta$ and assert that $\partial_{\pmb\beta}C_{OLS} = 0$ for the optimal predictor. Taking the partial derivative yields
            \begin{align}
                \begin{split}
                \pdv{\pmb\beta}C_{OLS}(\pmb\beta) = -2\textup{X}^T\qty(\mathbf y - \textup X\pmb \beta)
                \end{split}
            \end{align}
            We assert this is zero at the minima, which yields
            \begin{equation}
                \textup{X}^T\mathbf y = \textup{X}^T\textup{X}\pmb\beta
            \end{equation}
            then taking the inverse of $\textup{X}^T\textup{X}$ on both sides then gives the optimal $\pmb\beta$ as
            \begin{equation}
                \hat{\pmb \beta} = (\textup{X}^T\textup{X})^{-1}\textup{X}^T\mathbf y
            \end{equation}
            which mathematically is the best projection of the datapoints to our model. However, this may not actually yield the best fit in a qualitative sense, even if one disregards the risk of overfitting due to a poorly choosen basis\footnote{i.e an excessively high degree polynomial.}. Consider the case where we may have very high variance in certain regions of our dataset, OLS will then weight these regions in such a way that yields a poor fit in a qualitative sense. In order to deal with such situations, we apply alternate regression methods, which introduce additional tuning parameters that accounts for, and punishes the variance in the data sets as to yield a better model.
        \subsubsection{Ridge Regression}
            One such method is the Ridge regression, where the cost function is given as
            \begin{equation}
                C_{R}(\pmb \beta)
                = (\mathbf y - \textup{X}\pmb\beta)^T(\mathbf y - \textup{X}\pmb\beta)
                + \lambda \pmb\beta^T\pmb\beta
            \end{equation}
			
			The only difference between the cost function for OLS and Ridge regression is the addition of the "penalty" parameter $\lambda$ to the $L^2$ norm of the coefficients $\pmb{\beta}$. The main point of introducing this parameter is to reduce the variance of the regression coefficients $\pmb{\beta}$. It introduces a constraint on the allowable values of $\pmb{\beta}$, which means that the method no longer is unbiased. The aim is that the reduction of the variance outweighs the increase of the method's bias, leading to an overall lower test error, cf. the later discussion of the Bias-Variance Tradeoff.
            
        \subsubsection{Lasso Regression}
            \begin{equation}
                C_L(\pmb \beta) =
                \norm{\mathbf y - \textup{X}\pmb{\beta}}_2^2
                + \lambda\norm{\pmb{\beta}}_1
            \end{equation}
    \subsection{Singular Value Decomposition}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Discuss problems of $X^T X$ becoming singular in OLS, and how we use SVD to work around it.
        \end{itemize}

	The Lasso method is distinguished from the Ridge regression by which norm of $\pmb{\beta}$ is penalized. While the Ridge regression applies the penalty to the $L^2$ norm, the Lasso aims to shrink the $L^1$ norm. Two important consequences arise from this: firstly, it is no longer possible to obtain a closed-form solution to the minimization problem; secondly, the regression coefficients may be shrunk far more unevenly. In contrast to the Ridge regression, Lasso regression may shrink individual $\beta_{i}$ toward zero. This is an extremely useful property of the method, since it allows unimportant predictors to be identified and discarded. The drawback, of course, is that the bias of the Lasso method is expected to exceed the bias of the Ridge method.

    \subsection{Resampling}
        \noindent
        Resampling methods are ways in which we can generate new statistics from our existing data, which as the name suggests implies sampling new data sets from our already existing data. By doing so, we may gain new insigts about our data which may not be available through regular analysis, particularly in situations where we are limited by the number of data points.

        Here, we will focus on two of many such techniques.

        \subsubsection{Cross Validation}
            \noindent
            In the cross-validation resampling method, we split our data set $S$ into $k$ equally sized subsets $s_1, \dots, s_k$.
            We then for each $i = 1,\dots, k$ assign the $i$-th subset as the test set and the remaining $k-1$ subsets as the training set and compute the statistics in the usual way. Then at the end, we compute the mean value of the $k$ sets of statistics. A visual representation of this process can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig: Cross Validation}.
            \begin{figure}[h!tb]
                \center
                \input{../figs/cross_validation_fig.tex}
                \caption{\label{fig: Cross Validation}Visual representation of $k$-fold cross-sampling for $k=5$}
            \end{figure}
            When doing cross-validation, typical choices of $k$ are $5$ and $10$ \cite{hastie}. Which one is better will depend on how the error scales with the size of the training set, as such, choosing a suitable $k$ requires some analysis.
            The cross-validation resampling provides a good estimate for the mean error of our estimates.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Discuss this in more detail $\rightarrow\Delta Err$ wrt to number of data points
            \end{itemize}
        \subsubsection{Bootstrap}
            \noindent
            In the bootstrap resampling method, we sample our data set $S = \{s_1, \dots s_N\}$ $N$-number of times, in particular, we allow sampling the same $s_i$ multiple times. In this way, we generate new datasets in which some points are underweighted and others overweighted with respect to the original dataset $S$. So we effectively are generating small pertubations of the original dataset, which we may then use to compute new statistics.
            In particular, this technique enables us to investivate the variance of our model wrt small pertubations of the predictors. \textbf{This may be worded more elegantly}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item touch on rates of convergence
            \end{itemize}
