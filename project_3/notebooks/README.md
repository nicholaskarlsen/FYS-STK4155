## Explenation of notebooks

**PDE_NN_TEMTEST.ipynb** - Early developmental notebook for solving the heat equation with neural networks. Heavily inspired by code from the week 43 lecture notes, the network is implemented from scratch and the automatic differentiation is done by pure autograd. Not used in actual production, but might be capable of more clearly illustrating what's happening under the hood than the pytorch-based final notebooks. NO RESULTS FROM THIS NOTEBOOK APPEAR IN THE REPORT!

**Eigen_NN_TEMTEST.ipynb** - Early developmental notebook for solving the differential equation from Yi et al. Heavily inspired by code from the week 43 lecture notes, the network is implemented from scratch and the automatic differentiation is done by pure autograd. Not used in actual production, but might be capable of more clearly illustrating what's happening under the hood than the pytorch-based final notebooks. NO RESULTS FROM THIS NOTEBOOK APPEAR IN THE REPORT!

**Explicit_heat_eq.ipynb** - Contains the Finite-Differences implementation for the 1-D heat equation. Very straightforward, rather simplistic, and not too exciting.
